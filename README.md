[CubeStats](https://cube-stats.com) is an advanced data analytics and prediction program for [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) (WCA) data.

At the core of CubeStats is the CubeStats model. The CubeStats model is a Bayesian model built for every individual cuber-event pair in the WCA (around one million individual models!). It features informative priors trained from the collective results of tens of millions of times, smart weighting with both recency and solve count, and a unique, exactly calculated model derived from the more common normal-normal Bayesian model. Each cuber-event pair results in six parameters describing the distribution of results. For more information, see the upcoming blog post.

CubeStats also includes CubeSearch, a new search API for cubers in the WCA database. It's much faster than the official API, and can be [easily integrated](https://cube-stats.com/blog/cubesearch-v1.html) into most browsers.

There's much more on the horizon! Look out for blog posts with unique analytics, much more stats on each cuber's page, more useful predictions, and more!
